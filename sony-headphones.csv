"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on December 1, 2019",The best in-ear wireless earbuds I have tried at this price point,5.0,"I own several pairs of really high-end (and expensive) headphones and in-ear monitors (IEMs), but have been unable to carry them with me when moving around due to size and weight (and the fear of damage of loss).  Since I tried the original Air Pods I have been looking for wireless IEMs that give me the audio quality I want on the move, with the comfort I need for hours-long listening, and noise cancellation for office hums and buzzes or train noise.  I have about a half dozen wireless earphones I have tried and disliked for one reason or another in my closet, but now I have tried these Sony WF-1000XM3s I am a happy boy!The Sony earpods are available in two colours that I am aware of; I bought the silver because it didn't look as obvious as the black (your mileage may vary).  They come with a charging carry packet that charges with the supplied USB-C cable, a set of six ear pads (plus the two already on the earbuds), and some documentation.  It's a nicely packaged product, and after downloading the free app from the Apple Store,  I started in listening.  The earbuds twist in for a tighter fit, and I had to downsize them after a week's first listening to get a better seal, but the supplied ear tips are soft and easy to swap.  Gestures on the earbuds control functions, which take all of about five minutes to get comfortable with.There's two aspects to these Sony earbuds that stand out for me: audio quality and noise reduction.  The noise reduction is controllable and quite effective, as long as the seal on the ear pads is tight (otherwise noise leaks in, obviously).  As to the audio quality, when commuting or at the office I do most of my listening from satellite radio, or from lossless FLAC files on my iPhone.  Of course, the lossy streaming of satellite radio is not where near the quality of the FLAC files, but both sound really good on the Sony earbuds.  I compared the Sonys to some of my expensive IEMs in my living room, and there, critically listening, the Sony is simply not as good as the IEMs I tried, but keeping in mind the IEMs cost ten times the price of the Sony earbuds, there's nothing embarrassing about that. I also compared these Sonys to my older Apple Air Pod, and like the Sony audio quality much, much more.  I have yet to try the latest generation of Air Pods, so can't speak about them in comparison, but now I won't be buying the Air Pods at all!I am really happy and pleased with these Sony earbuds.  They are not cheap, bvut they are not expensive either (compared to some IEMs on the market).  I use these Sonys almost every day and am delighted with the sound and the battery life.  Definately recommended.Follow-up: I have now compared these Sonys to the new Air Pod and the Sony wins in terms of sound quality by a considerable margin.  Also, to answer peoples questions about fit, the interchangeable tips should allow you to customize the fit for your needs.  I end up using a different size tip in each ear for a perfect fit and to hold them in place when exercising.  I still love these Sonys, and use them far more than my ten-times-the-price IEMs."

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 20, 2019",Sony WF-1000XM3 Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds (Honest View),4.0,"The Sony WF-1000XM3 Wireless Earbuds my interest originally from all various reviews of the product on both pro's & cons please bare in mind nothing is perfect at launch, unlike other reviewers in a mad panic spat. Let's I guess start with the build quality as you expect in general ear buds are made with a hardened plastic but didn't feel to cheaply manufactured. The charger case or dock, I was impressed from the design sony whet with not as bulky as some brands but not fully compact as the Samsung Galaxy buds. They seemed to have chosen a durable rubber for the outside casing with aluminum for the lid case, I will point out it does seem it could easily be scratched. Another feature which may not concern is the case has no wireless charging just only via USB-C.Now for the overall fit within the ear it's imperfect it's not for everyone since each person is different. And as other reviewers pointed out the earbuds are designed to go deeper in the ear canal. For a sound tight seal to get a better sound signature along with noise isolation. You best options would be to try it for yourself, so far the seal and fit in my ears are alright I haven't tried the other options in ear tips provided. So far they haven't fallen out easily but I were to shake my head like a madman I could see them falling out of my ears. As for the IR sensor build in the earbuds it's useful between removing them in or out of your ears, only seems to pair to my Android device only after I placed them my ears. As for in ear fatigue from listening or watching hours worth of content only a slight hint of fatigue for myself.Sound quality is impressive for these earbuds very similar sound signature to the Sony WH-1000XM3 over ear headphones. I will note there is a slight more bass response not overwhelming, Treble is detailed both singers/ instruments are clear naturally sounding. Mid range sounds are present and balanced and no conflict problems, bass is well done. Not that annoying unnatural buss from beats products uck. I haven't noticed the bass being muddy on either slow or fast paced music. Sony built in chip to improve sound quality on older audio files does help but if you use a music app player you'll have to disable the EQ. Bear in mind the noise cancelling on these earbuds are decent but not as good as the over-ear headset available from Sony. You can still hear your own voice when talking but as first subtle sounds and noises it does a good job. The over-ear headphones from Sony are more aggressive and with cancelling.Bluetooth 5.0 connection's/calling quality.Connection wise I haven't encountered any difficulties yet but I know it could possibly happen if I were to leave my smartphone in a different room. As for call Quality the comments I got from my friends is it's clear when it's in an quiet area but I haven't tried it out in a public space yet say as in traffic as an example. The only complaint I received what's an annoying Buzz Echo but then disappeared after I reset and reconnected the Bluetooth earbuds. Hasn't happened since to date, at this time battery life is fair roughly 5 hours and 26 minutes with N/C turned on. With N/C turned off roughly only gained roughly 18 more additional minutes.Overall opinion give it try for yourself and decide on your own discretion and if you don't like it, return the product after all that's the benefit of Amazon's 30 day return policy unless you damaged the product.ProsSound qualityBuild in featuresPortability compact casedecent noise cancellingUSB CConsNo wireless chargingNo water/sweat resistant not for the gymPossible problems in cold weather TBDSony warranty is different to utilize"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 28, 2019",Best in category,5.0,"These are not your bargain knockoff earbuds.  If price is an issue then move on.  These are by far the best in-ear noise cancelling earbuds on the market.  While they are not up to the noise cancelling found in the over the ear Sony WH1000XM3 they offer a great tradeoff for those seeking greater portability.The sound is fantastic, crisp, deep, and rich .  To get the most out of these make sure you choose the proper sized nibs.  This makes a world of difference in the quality of the user experience."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 7, 2019",Works very good,4.0,"I came to these headphones from a pair of Sure SE215's. Needless to say, my expectations were high as an audiophile.They fit comfortably. They don't have the same memory foam as the Sure's have, but they are very comfortable and they stay in place well. The noice cancelation is scary good. Like I mean it works SO well. The sound and bass is surprisingly good, but the highs get a little distorted by the Noise Cancelation. Also they don't go nearly as loud as the SE215's but with noise cancelation on, you don't need it so loud. The app is amazing and has WAAAAY more customization options that the AirPods. The app is just ....sexy. lolA definite recommendation if you are an audiophile. I didn't even consider the AirPods Pro. It looses a star because of the volume issue."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on August 15, 2019",Kept falling off,1.0,I tried everything even looked at their tutorial on how to use these but nothing helped. The earphones just kept falling off. Returned the same day.
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 19, 2019",Has the potential to be perfect.,4.0,"Almost perfect product. Very sad that some bugs are holding it back. The firt bug that I have discovered is if you enable Google assistant as one of your buttons it will transform your buds to master and slave, what that means is that if you want to listen with only one bud the one with Google assistant will be working, but the other one wont work without the other. So what I ended up doing is just ditching google assistant and going back to the ambient sound control, you can still use google assistant with your phones mic. The second bug that I noticed has to do with automatic power off if buds are left alone for about 5 mins, I found it very buggy, and frustrating, because when you pick the bud back up, and try to use it, it wont work, makes you do all this gimmicky stuff with disconnecting headphones from ur bluetooth settings, waiting, etc. But if you shut them off manually through the app it works seamlessly when you pick them back up they just connect as you would pull them out of the case... I tried to just turn off that automatic shut down, but then you're stuck with flashing blue light even if you have them in your ears... And that brings me to the final point is that these buds dont have that much flexibility specifically with the flashing lights... I understand they're trying to prevent us from losing them in the dark, but thats on us.Anyways overall buds are great, the sound quality is fire, they're very comfortable (for me, ur ears could be different, but I can wear them for the whole day with mild uncomfortabilty at the end of the day). Battery is very good. Case is nice, and slick. They look nice in ears, and equalizer settings do make difference. Just really wish sony invested it better beta testers, found all these bugs in like few hours of listening... Hopefully things I meantioned get fixed soon in the future.Oh and final tip is that I recommend using mesh plugs as they help your ears breath more preventing them to be sweaty. 👍"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 13, 2019",So far awesome,4.0,"I was a bit hesitant picking these up as I've tried a couple different bluetooth wireless sets, Bose being the most expensive, and have been really disappointed. Thus far though these are living up to the hype. I have only had them drop connection once to my phone and haven't had them lose connection with each other at all.Pros:- The sound is fantastic, seriously awesome. For tiny, in-ear headphones the base is great.- They feel secure and comfortable in the ear when fitted properly- The connection to my phone and between each ear pieces has been strong no matter the environment. My other bluetooth headsets struggled to find my phone in my back pocket...not these.- The app works well and is intuitive- Battery life is good- Set-up and use is easyCons:- I don't love the foam or rubber sleeves that come with these. I couldn't manage to find a fit for one of my ears. Luckily I have extra Shure foam sleeves , which are compression based, and once I replaced the sony ones I was good to go.- Getting them to stay powered down in a pocket while outside of their case, is a bit of a pain. They automatically turn off after 5 minutes, except when they don't. If they are in a pocket and you are moving they will stay alive and drain the battery. You can force power them down in the app, yet motion wakes them back up so same issue. It's a minor gripe, yet I don't want to always carry the case so it's an issue for me.- The touch controls are a bit overly sensitive and non-intuitive. It takes some practice to hit them just right.Overall these are hands down the best truly wireless bluetooth headphones I have tried. I am happy with the purchase and have retired my wired bluetooth headphones for these."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on September 29, 2020",Wanted to like them but they're not for me,2.0,"I gave these an honest try and wanted to like them but I ended up not keeping them.  The deal breaker is the microphone quality: it's horrible.  Call quality is very poor.  Outgoing sound is bad and cuts in and out.  Quite surprised that Sony would sell $300 earbuds with such horrible mics. These earbuds all have much better mics:  Airpods Pro, Galaxy Buds Plus, Galaxy Buds Live.  They were also uncomfortable, protruded out too much and felt like they would fall out.  I tried all the tips in the box.  All no good for me.  Their instructions to insert and twist don't work for my ears. Also, the case is too big compared to what's available.  If you don't care about making audio or video calls and find them comfortable to wear, the sound quality when listening to music is excellent."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 27, 2019",Fails to function as a basic headset,1.0,"It is a shame that Sony has made a product with fancy noise cancelling features, but fails to perform the basic voice call tasks. This headset performs extremely poorly when you are speaking on the phone. The person on the other end cannot hear what you are saying because the headset drops every other word, and the volume of your voice is extremely low. Very disappointed, my $20 wireless earbuds do a better job like this. If you are always on business trips and join Skype meetings all the time, this is definitely not the option for you!"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 24, 2020",Average sound quality - disappointing for the price,3.0,"I purchased these earbuds as my first expensive earbuds after years of purchasing under $120 earbuds. Every review stated that these Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds are considered the best. I thought that as a treat for my wife, I would buy these for her and take back my $70 Anker Soundcore Liberty Lite (https://www.amazon.ca/Soundcore-Truly-Wireless-Sweatproof-Headphones-Graphene-Enhanced/dp/B07M8LNBNB), which are actually quite good.The first compared the sound quality between the two... imagine my utter disbelief that the Soundcores actually seem to sound better than the Sony earbuds. How is this possible? I was careful to ensure that I tested at a flat EQ.Update: After a few days of testing different genres of lossless (full quality) music between myself and two others (they didn't know the brand or the cost of the earbuds - to minimize bias), everyone agreed that the Anker earbuds sounded marginally better.What are the important differences between the Sony and Anker earbuds?Sony:Pros: Larger sound stage (but this quality improvement doesn't justify an additional $200). USB-C support.Cons: Almost 3x more costly. Less bass and treble range (at flat EQ), took about 40 minutes to setup with app configuration, and firmware update. No support for multipoint BT.Anker:Pros: Seems to sound like it has a wider frequency range from low base to high treble (at flat EQ). Much less expensive, smaller case with greater battery capacity, three white LEDs to indicate level of base battery, quicker to setup.Cons: smaller soundstage, no app for customization, older model (but I am thinking that the newest Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro are even better).I really don't like returning Amazon purchases, but I just cannot justify the cost of these earbuds compared to the better sounding Anker earbuds.Two lessons learned:1) You get what you pay for isn't always true.2) Don't always assume that professional reviews are true or accurate. I purchased the Sony earbuds because all the pro reviewers were saying that these were the best!"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on April 26, 2020",Not worth the money,2.0,"I was so looking forward to these ear buds.I have the Sony WH-1000Xm3 over the ear headphones and was expecting the same quality for these buds.Not so.The noise cancelling is minimal. Didn't cancel the vacuum cleaner or the tractor and chainsaw next door very much.Didn't like the fit. They stayed in my ear but were not all that comfortable.Whenever you go to tweak the fit , the slightest touch will change the noise cancelling setting or stop the play, hated that.The sound is ok the equalizer in the app helped a bit, but because of the fit the sound always sounded thin, like I needed to adjust the unit in my ear.The case needs a flat bottom imho. I would like to have been able to stand the case on a flat surface with the lid up, not lay it on it's side. Poor design if you ask me.I have to admit that I like my Soundpeats for $45 much better.These are just not worth the $$$ imho.So far the best bang for MY listening buck are the WH-1000Xm3 over the ear headphones.Give these buds a pass.Returned them."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on May 30, 2020",Do Not Buy!!,1.0,"I’ve been an unfortunate owner of one of these and after a few months and tons of firmware updates, resetting both headsets and my iPhone XS Max as well as their app updates, I came to conclusion that SONY truly sucks!!Terrible audio calls quality - Bluetooth disconnections - and is unable to even save its own audio settings!Noise cancellation?? Don’t let me go there!!Buy a $20 headset because they last longer and serve you much better - and if you don’t like it, you wouldn’t scratch your head what to do with $300+ piece of junk by SONY!!UPDATE on June 23, 2020:------------------------------I stand by my 1 STAR rate!Tried to live with this because after all I spent so much on it!A few useless firmware and painfully SLOW updates, things have gone from bad to terrible! It cannot even hold BT connection whether listening to music, watching Netflix, phone calls on either iPhone XS Max, iPad Pro 2019, Apple TV 4K, MacBook Air 2018, ASUS VivoBook running Win10 Pro!!I have reset my devices as well as this product over and over and over but nothing helped.Solution: Back to Apple AirPods Pro! YES, if you live in Apple walled-garden, then stay there! It's a jungle out there and SONY rules when it comes to selling overpriced useless junks!"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 18, 2020",What you want to know. Are these better then the Apple AirPod Pros???,5.0,"Yes, definitely yes.Here's my comparison.I have the AirPod pro's, which I've decided to give to my wife, and the Sony WF1000XM3. I am really disappointed in the AirPods pro's noise-cancelling feature.  When I turn it on, seriously there is no difference in the sound coming in. It lets in everything. There is NO DIFFERENCE. Plus,  they keep falling out of my ear.When I heard the noise cancelling of the Sony's, WOW. The background noise floor just dropped away. The music quality, amazing to me. The bass (I like to have it much lower to protect my hearing) is great. To me, the sound quality is much better than the air pods at first sounding, requires a bit of adjusting. So wifie gets the air pods pro, she's happy. I get the Sony xm3's hubby happy. It's a win-win for me.BTW, the Sony case looks fine. I like the champagne accent colour. The silver version also looks nice. The look of the Sony ear pods themselves looks fine too. Yes, they are a bit larger but with that, you get more performance that comes with it. I want more features and performance any day. I mean, are you getting any dates cause you're wearing Apple AirPod pros??When it comes to sound to me:AirPods Pro: Flatter sound, more close to a record maybe, there is bass but it's not painful. It's at a good amount.WF1000xm3's: Out of the box it sounds great. More digitized than the AirPod Pros in that the sound seems more 3D with highs seemingly coming from different directions. Very good depth. The bass while good is a bit sharp. After a minute I get ear pain that I don't get with the AirPod pros. I'veComparing the two to me the Sony's seem to have more of just base and highs whereas the AirPod pros seem to be more balanced across the sound stage. The Sony's also seem to have more of a depth of sound, fuller sound stage then the AirPods. I believe Jay's correct in that at first glance the Sony's sound better but after a while may need some tweaking in the eq settings. I find the eq very helpful as it has a dedicated bass slider that helps in toning down the punchiness of the base.Overall. The Sony's definitely come out on top for me.Oh, the button controls on the AirPods are HORRIBLE. Rarely works the way and when you want. Sony's work great."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on May 12, 2020",Sony....What did you do?!,5.0,"I have to say thease blew me away, for some people say the noise cancelling was not good, some handy advice for them they give you multiple sets sizes...they give you a entire guide to explain how they need to fit....if you do it correctly....it works perfectly.The ear pecices fit in (my) ears perfectly to the point I'll forget I have them in....it gets to the point that it just sounds like your head litterly is playing a digital sound file directly to your brain....it's kinda freaky sometimes.I have very small to little pairing issues some discounts...but very few...The small pet peeve for this Bluetooth system, if you pair to your car...(yes don't earbud and drive) the ear pecices will disconnect...any device that connects to your phone that plays audio will override your earbuds.Other than that .. .sony.....you have created a masterpiece, the price is acceptable for what you receive.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 23, 2020","Great hardware, software could use work",4.0,"Coming from a custom-molded earphone fitted to my ear, the passive noise cancellation doesn't hold up but it's adequate I guess.The active noise cancellation is a mixed bag. Most of the time it works great, but there's a number of different options you can choose from within the app and unfortunately they don't have a mode that's good for both noise cancellation and a wind filter at the same time. I find I have to choose between the two and this becomes a problem when you're walking in a wind tunnel environment. I find if I wear a hoody over the mic of the ear pieces that is greatly improves upon the wind filter, but for something in this price range you'd expect better algorithms to be able to completely filter that out.I've also haven't found a good way to listen to people around me even if I pause my music. I have to hold my finger on the touch control to boost their voices, which imo, should be the default behavior when the music is paused.The touch controls on the ear pieces are a nice feature, but I wish the app would give you more fine grained control. As-is, you can only select between different ""modes"" with their predefined actions. I would prefer to be able to pick and choose actions individually.Battery pretty much lasts forever in my use-cases. Unless I'm listening to music from the start of my day to the end of my work shift non-stop, I don't need to worry about battery life. Plus the quick charge basically makes it so you never need to care (assuming you're carrying the case with you).It comes with a bunch of different ear fittings to match your size. I find the default size fit me well in both hot and cold weather. Never had any problems with it falling out or becoming uncomfortable."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 22, 2019",It's not all that bad... but it's not great either.,3.0,"These TWS, man, what a ride.Originally preordered these 3 months ago, only to have Amazon.ca cancel it. Wasn't happy at all. Then a few weeks later the silver version had only a few units in stock so I pulled the trigger.First impressions **were not great**. Benson Leung said these are ""a little buggy"" - he wasn't joking. On the second time using it, the right earbud simply stopped working. No amount of putting them back into case, taking it back out, unpairing and re-pairing worked. Ended up performing a full factory reset. If I'm not a techie, I'd have returned these already.Earlier this month, that same right earbud lost connection and ""rebooted"" while, ironically, inside an Apple Store. I was like, ""what the hell is wrong with these things?""The comfort leaves something to be desired. The replaceable eartips are the only part of the earbuds that stay in the ear. You can't just put them on like you would every other pair of wired/wireless earbuds, as they will fall out. I've had them fall out twice. The ""correct"" way of putting these on is to orient the earbuds downwards as you put them into the ear, then twist them towards the front for a *slightly more secure grip*. You heard that right; they still aren't truly secure when worn this way. That's worse than the OG AirPods, which stay in the ear only because of direct contact with the skin and have no eartips to begin with.Charging case is big. Think one of those newer power banks with 2x 21700 cells in terms of relative size. Both the WI-C310 and SBH56 (both made by Sony) are smaller than the WF-1000xm3 all-in. At least it can be charged from a USB Type C power source, as opposed to so many cheap crap out there that have USB-C but require legacy USB-A to USB-C to charge.Noise cancellation is pretty good for a set of TWS. No complaints about sound quality. Battery life is similar to my experience with Apple's AirPods, as in, very rarely do I use them for so long that the low battery warning comes up.So why the 3-star rating?Apple released the AirPods Pro late last month to little fanfare, like the OG AirPods. Normally I'm not a fan: Apple refused to update the port to USB-C on their most current-year iPhones, and the AirPods also stayed on Lightning, so to use their latest $329 TWS I'd have to bring along a separate USB-C to Lightning cable just to charge them. Do not want. But someone on the /r/USBCHardware subreddit posted that IKEA has a 5W Qi wireless charger, **LIVBOJ**, which ended up being a no-brainer impulse buy because:1. not only does it have a native USB-C port for input, it also works with USB-C power sources and eMarked cables;2. the pad is the same size as a typical circular drink coaster; and3. it costs literally $8 with taxes.LIVBOJ turns the AirPods Pro into an USB-C-enabled TWS. Like the Xperia 1, the WF-1000xm3 has no wireless charging, so the value proposition of Sony's TWS became harder to justify. It's pretty good when it works, the problem is when it *doesn't*.It's hard to rate this more than 3 stars now that the 800-pound gorilla resolved the single biggest complaint with the OG AirPods, namely the lack of noise isolation/cancellation."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on April 12, 2020",They'd be mediocre if they worked. Don't waste your money.,2.0,"I like to leave reviews that are thoughtful and not biased by anger but this has been the most frustrating experience with a piece of technology I have ever had.Let's be clear, the purpose of earbuds is to connect to something and make noise. These do the opposite of that. Connecting is not difficult my phone, laptop, computer, watch, and everything else connect fine. The NFC chip speeds it up more. These buds do not, however, stay connected long enough to regularly finish a song. On top of that, the app does not recognize that they're connected to my phone if I've already connected them. I have to disconnect them, open the app, and then search for them while they're still in the case. There's definitely more things that are frustrated but those are minor in comparison to the literal inability to use them.The sound quality is good but max volume is quiter than average.Battery life is great. Sony has tried to tell me the connection issues are battery related. Sony is wrong; I haven't been able to use them for more than five minutes and the app says they are fully charged.My final note is on Sony themselves. Sony has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have spent 7 hours trying to get these, at the very least, repaired. That's enough time for me to have bought another pair. I would be fine with these problems if they'd solve them but Sony Is clearly incapable of response.I am frustrated and feel robbed. Please don't waste your money."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on December 19, 2020",Can't use for phone calls: Mic is too sensitive,2.0,"First, sound quality is fantastic. Music sounds great.BIG BUTIf there is absolutely any background noise, you can't make phone calls with these. The person on the other side of the call will hear every little sound, and they will find it very hard to hear you. Even the tiniest sounds get picked up and transmitted. Many friends have asked me to not call them if I am using these to make a phone call. I chatted with Sony support about this, this is what they said:Sony: ""We kindly inform you that your voice is heard from the headset through the headset’s microphone (Sidetone function). In this case, ambient sounds or the sounds of the headset operation may be heard through the headset, but this is not a malfunction... We kindly inform you that is not possible to disable the sidetone function on this device... The unit has a one year warranty, however as mentioned above the unit supports the sidetone function so you can hear your voice during a call, the unit does not support the filtering of background noise but the device can still be used to make phone calls because it has a microphone. ""My response: ""Yes but I can only make phone calls in a silent environment.  That was not mentioned in the product materials""Sony: ""I understand your concern and we apologize for the inconvenience but in this case you will required a professional headset designed to take calls in a working environment.""Me: ""You mean like Apple AirPods? Because those work, and you are advertising this as an alternative. Anyway, the advertising is misleading. You really can't make phone calls with this device. Really a shame. I was hoping you'd tell me about something I can do, but you're basically saying there's nothing I can do.""Sony:  ""We are truly sorry that the headset did not meet your expectations. This is the normal operation of the unit so is not a defect that is covered by the warranty. ""If you want to make phone calls, do not use these. Sony could probably fix this in firmware, to some degree, but it seems like they won't."

Well Sony is definitely a reputable brand and they make great products. Construction of the Sony M3 headphones feel really nice, the charging case also feels like its made from quality material. The magnets inside the charging housing holds the earbuds in tight with the magnets inside.The sound quality blew my expectations out of the water. The clarity of the headphones really give these headphones the credit it deserves. The bass hits nice and couldn't be any happier.There are more positives to these headphones like the touch controls, battery, etc.....The only CON i have and which is why I deducted 1 star would be because of the annoying connection issues when paired. Many times my earbuds disconnect from my phone for no reason, and other times when only 1 headphones will work even after numerous attempts of resetting the earbuds by putting them inside the charging case.All in all, I feel like these Sony WF-1000XM3 are a great pair of earbuds, definitely worth purchasing especially if on sale."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 24, 2020",Excellent Sound Poor Software,4.0,"Crystal clear sound, excellent bass for such a small form factor. I would have rated these Earbuds a 5 star except for the ""Smart Listening"" adaptive sound control, which annoyingly announces in-ear that it is switching with a chime and a slight pause in sound. It's like the earbuds are announcing that it is doing something good and giving itself a pat on the back. It should be doing this seamlessly without the chime and pause. Every time I stand up or make a new movement while listening to music, it chimes and pauses the music.  For the high price, these earbuds should do their job without the need to interrupt my listening pleasure! I'm not a technical expert so I'm not sure if this can be corrected with a software update or if it's a hardware limitation issue."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on February 22, 2020",Excellent sound and fit,4.0,"The sound is excellent with ANC.  The sound does lose some bass overtones when anc is off so need to tweak the equalizer.  I leave ANC on and enjoy the great soundstage.  The sound is much better than the Jabra 75t as far as fidelity and clarity, and soundstage.  The ear buds don't give you that  occlusion issue with blocked ears.  For me the fit is excellent (with the large silicones) and are secure.  Don't run with them so can't comment on how well they would stay.  I tried to like the Jabra but ended up returning them and staying with these for the sound quality.Cons.  Wish they allowed to have ambiant sound control as well as volume and track control at the same time on the button configurations.  Right now, you lose one set of control to have volume control on the button.Would also be nice that turning noise control off would not affect the overall sound like it does now.Overall , a great set of buds for the audiophile, commuter or casual listener.  Not so much for heavy activity with the potential for getting the buds wet."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 22, 2021",Noise cancelling in IEMs doesn't really work well?,3.0,"PURPOSESPriority I - noise cancelling on public transit in Canada and on the streets of Asian metropoli. Anyone who has spent time in HCMC or Kolkata will understand.Priority II - everything else weighted much lower, with extras in this order - battery [seems acceptable], reliability [jury in my head is out], post-sale service [adequate], and no-brainer operation [bit fancy as I prefer mechanical buttons however not much space to put them, and maybe I will get used to tapping and swiping]. Quality of audio and customization of buttons and fancy features are not so important to me. I just want an IEM that excels at NC. Spoiler: these are not them.PositivePortability: +5/5, smaller case than I expected, magnetic to hold in budsValue: + 3.5/5, because I bought a warranteed used pair, I paid about half price.Music: 4/5, They sound better (richer and more detailed) than my 800Ns. Not a huge improvement, but significant enough.Appearance: 4.5/5, despite the half off price for 'used' the cosmetic damage is insignificant - two 1 cm scuffs on the case only. Whoop de doo.NegativeNoise cancelling: -2/5, about what I expected for a cheaper IEM, unsatisfactory for my purposes (see my review on 800N). Doesn't seem any better than my other cheaper true wireless earphones. Turning on 'noise cancelling' I can still hear the whipping gas fireplace flames  0.5 M to my left and the air purifier whirring 6M directly in front of me. No change to environmental noise and I have my setting to let in the least outside noise. Yes, I went to the headphone app and changed it.So, let me try using my super-duper quality and smaller size Taiwanese ear tips... Result? Better fit but no better NC. OK, trouble-shooting here. Let me try changing to different Sony eartips that came w/ package... I choose the smallest grey ones with salmon-coloured inner ring. They appear to be foam... Nope, nothing to write home about. Maybe NC is ever so slightly better.Standing outside at the curb in my suburb as rush hour started I found the whishing by of the cars unaffected. Thing is, as I have tinnitus and sometimes hyperacusis, I don't need low drones cancelled. In fact I like and need regular low-pitch noises for my sanity. What I need cancelled are all the medium to high pitch loud sudden noises (like girls screaming with glee in playground, barking dogs, ambulance sirens, etc). These 1000XM3s seem to be as useless as the 800Ns. Well, not 100% useless, but when you insulate a house it is useless to do so just 20%. Wind and sound are similar aren' they?Comfort: -3/5, 800N is tactiley less noticeable on my ear compared to this model. I suspect this is due to different textures of exterior plastic and because the cheaper one has stabilizing fins.Connection: 3/5, sound comes and goes, clicking sounds if I move my bidy and gave phone in my pocket. Not 100% reliable. I could live with one glitch every day or two, but not dozens per hour. I thought it might be my phone, but operating w/built-in speaker I get no crackles and pops.Case for eartips: -2/5,  firstly, couldn't Sony include packaging for the ear tips that could actually be reused as a case? Mine won't re-shut w/o cello tape. Secondly, the actual charging case is so compact that if one changes to core-compatible eartips that are longer or wider (say triple phalange silicone or wider foamies for superior isolation), this would mean storing buds outside the case unless I want to put them on and off every use - wear and tear don't you think?I don't like being invested in a brand so much that I can't use third-party alternatives. That was my issue with Apple. Does Sony make an external set of wires for free-form (no case) charging? I doubt it.Calls: -1/5, why such a low rating? While listening to music my first call came in. Sound quality was so-so (could be our phones, not the earphones - I know for a fact that at least one of our phones is a lemon). The ringtone was a bit silly - I'll see if there is a way to change it. Much more important, I got a disconnected alert (I was using my Android Motorola G7 Power smartphone). Wheels spinning. I have no idea if my phone disconnected the earphones or visa versa. In any case there seems to be a compatibility issue.Naming: 0/5, Who can remember such flavourless model names, combinations of 10-characterletters and numbers. 'Apple' is easy to remember. 'Firefox' too. Do the marketers at Sony have no common sense? I mean, how difficult can it be to come up with visually impressive names?NeutralColour: 0 1.5/5, muddy grey colour, *not* silver! Not even close. Will be hard to identify across a room. A bit ugly really. I didn't ask for rumpus room beige. 'Silver' implies bright light and sparkles. Hardly.BT signal: 3/5, I did the same moving around my apartment real world test. I went around the corner and behind a door, perhaps 10M. Broke up just like with the 800N. This is normal? A phone problem?Conclusion: Must buy top-end  over the ear NC headphones to use at home. Are Sony IEMS a step in the right direction, for travel anyway? Maybe. Time on the road will tell. So far, I'm not convinced. It seems that even top end 'noise cancelling' earphones (both of Sony's anyway) either require a lot of ear tip fitting, that is finding the perfect ear tip according to ear shape and size, plus considering listening needs, to do the job. Or simply none actually work.In my very limited testing experience with Bose and Sony , in-ear noise cancels nominally and over-ear NCs marginally. These are just earbuds in a nice case. Will I keep them? Undecided."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 11, 2020",To keep or not to keep?,3.0,"Sound quality is quite good if you can get a good seal.  I actually bought the Comply foams in an effort to get a good seal and prevent them from falling out of my ears.  They stay in reasonably well now.  I do have issues.  First, it took ten attempts to pair them with my iPhone.  I have not been able to pair them with my iPad at all.  I even had them ""forget"" my iPhone but still failed. Then, multiple attempts to get the iPhone paired again.  Both devices ""see"" the headset but fail to pair.  Second, the noise reduction doesn't do much.  It did not suppress road noise in the car, for example, so not as effective as my wired Westones when properly seated.  I may still keep them if the pairing improves since my next phone won't have a headphone socket.  We'll see.  Follow-up:  In the end, I decided to keep them.  The sound really good for wireless.  Of course, they can't compare to good wired IEMs and I still wouldn't wear them over the toilet, being afraid they would fall out but they are great for around the house and out for a walk."

I have a very good pair of custom fit earphones that are the standard, hard wired earphones that we have used for many years.  The sound quality from those is clearly superior to these Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds, but they should be as they cost many times what the Sony did.  I love the convenience of the bluetooth earphones and the sound quality has finally reached a point that I can truly enjoy music through these.  It is a pleasure to not have to have cables, adaptors and such to get good sound quality out of my phone's music selection.  Very happy with this purchase.  The traditional earphones still sound better, but these are very convenient and quite good for what they are."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on February 7, 2020",A great pair of (expensive) true wireless earbuds,5.0,"When I bought these, I was half expecting that I wouldn't like what I was getting for the (admittedly, very) high price point of $300 CAD and I would just return them and buy the $100 cheaper Samsung Galaxy Buds.To my surprise (and pleasure!), I found I really enjoyed using these right out of the box and after a couple weeks of intensive use at home (I've forced myself to use these instead of my typical over-ear headphones), work/school and to and from work/school and home, I'm not enjoying them any less. The greatest contributing factor, as it should be with any audio device, is the quality of audio that comes out of them, in which these surely do not disappoint.However, when using these earbuds, I think there are multiple factors that contribute to why I like them so much, so I will elaborate on each factor below.In terms of build quality, I have no complaints. Everything feels well built and premium (which is what you should be getting at the price point). I can't comment on long term durability at this point, but impressions after two weeks of pretty heavy use is good. Comfort is also good, but not perfect (probably around a 4/5). In the first few days of using them, my ears would start to feel a little sore after a few hours of continuous use, but it would only feel so if I took them out (not while I was wearing them). After a week or so, this went away and I can use these for hours at a time without feeling any discomfort. Your mileage may vary, depending on personal factors like ear shape.Speaking of using for hours on end, battery life is excellent. I haven't used them for 6 hours straight, so I've never drained them, but I have used them for 2-3 hours at a time and in that time, the battery rarely ever goes below 70% (as indicated on the companion app). If you couple this with the fast charging case, if you just pop these back in for a few minutes at a time every couple hours, it's very easy to keep the battery topped up. Overall, considering that I always keep active noise cancelling on, the battery life is excellent.Connectivity is solid, but not perfect. Pairing is easy with NFC and connecting occurs relatively quickly once you pull the headphones out of the case. During use, I have had a few occasions where sound will drop for a very brief moment (typically where there is more interference). I have had a few issues where the earbuds will randomly drop the volume super low. I'm not sure if this is due to my phone, music player or the earbuds themselves, but simply reconnecting resolves the issue. The companion app works well enough and is a convenient place to update firmware and tweak settings (like EQ and setting the level of ambient sound). Touch controls on the earbuds themselves are a bit finicky but fine once you get used to them. Sony also recently updated the firmware on these, allowing for volume control from touch controls (a feature that some other reviews might be missing).The noise cancelling, for being found on such a small piece of hardware, is surprisingly good. I think it's important to remember that noise cancelling is never perfect and will always struggle with things like voices and random, higher frequency noises. Having said that, if you have find the tips that fit correctly, the passive noise isolation is pretty good, and if you layer on top of that, music at a reasonable volume and the active noise cancelling, you will have trouble hearing outside noises (including voices etc.). I've used these in a few different contexts (on the bus/train, in the office, in a research lab with considerable background noise, at home). In each case, the noise cancelling performed admirably. The typically noisy hum of the bus and train is quite effectively blocked out by the ANC. The ANC on a small pair of earbuds like these is not going to be as effective as the ANC on higher end, over ear headphones (like the Sony WH1000XM3 or Bose QC35II), but considering what these are, I would say the ANC is more than good enough. However, I haven't flown with these yet, so the verdict is still out for that scenario.Now, for the most important part: the sound. No matter how great everything I just talked about was, if I did not like the way these sounded, I would have returned these in a heartbeat. After all, what's the point of having an expensive pair of earbuds (that might otherwise be great) if you don't like listening to music on them? Fortunately, I was not let down by the sound quality. These are a pleasure to listen to. The sound is nice and clear, and doesn't sound congested as some in-ear earphones can. The sound is surprisingly balanced. I expected these to be much bassier, but I did not find the bass muddy or overwhelming. The bass sounds full and clear with good sub-bass. Mids sound nice and clear, not overly recessed. Treble is also clear and sparkly but not harsh and fatiguing. Vocals sound great, although I will say there is slightly more sibilance on these than I would prefer. They sound great across a variety of genres. If you like EDM, the great bass and sparkly treble make these very give your tracks a lot of impact. But they also sound fantastic if you like more instrumental music (I listen to a lot of JPop/anime music). I don't use any EQ, as I prefer the stock sound compared to the different EQ profiles that Sony has on their app. I have seen people recommend the ""excited"" preset, but for my tastes, it makes the earbuds sound a little too V-shaped (treble becomes too sparkly, a bit too harsh, and the bass is boomier).Overall, I think the best way to describe what I think of the sound on these is I like them. They sound good. Are these going to give you the same level of audio quality as a same priced wired IEMs or headphones? Probably not. Do I care? Not really. I don't have high end audio ear, but I do have a couple pairs of more expensive (entry level audiophile) headphones (my go to being Sennheiser HD58X Jubilees) and I enjoy listening to these as much as I like listening to those. Plus, those aren't true wireless or noise cancelling. It's harder use them in the office or the lab. And for the convenience and features that these earbuds afford you, the sound is darn impressive. In the end, sound quality is subjective and can depend on other factors, like ear canal shape or age, and so the best way to tell if you'll like how these sound (if you are really up to spending the $300 these cost) is just buy these and try them out (you can always return later).In conclusion, these are a fantastic pair of earbuds. The convenience of true wireless, great battery life, good connectivity and comfort and great sound quality make for a great product that I don't hesitate to recommend. (If you're ok with spending $300 on a pair of earbuds that is...)"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 12, 2019","Great sound, less comfortable than Bose, great noise cancelling",4.0,I returned my Bose wired headphones because of the annoying mic rubbing against clothes sound and got these instead to help reduce auditory overstimulation while walking in the city and studying at usually noisy libraries. The sound quality was so much nicer that I actually held back tears thinking that my playlists was so freaking beautiful sounding. The noise canceling was not noticeable much at home but at the library it was dead silent ... so much so that I felt anxious that someone might be behind me. I’ll get used to it. There’s still the sound of the mic rubbing clothes...this time my winter hat. The inserts don’t fit perfectly despite being provided with seven options. They also felt somewhat painful to wear at about 2/10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is having your ears chopped off.

The sound quality is impressive, and by that I mean, a reasonable balance of the frequencies. No *over* emphasis of bass, for example. Bass heads will find a better match elsewhere. The noise cancelling is top-of-the-line for in-ears. So many reviews of in-ears emphasize the noise cancellation and treat the sound quality as secondary. I did my research to find a pair of ""truly-wireless in-ears"", and these Sony's were it. *Highly Recommended*. Especially great value if you use Amazon Warehouse options. The Sony headphones app has many options, including dialing in the amount of noise cancellation, EQ, etc. I found the app works well for iOS/Apple."

I purchased the sennheiser momentum 2 for myself a few months ago and have been satisfied with it.  My priorities were for sweat resistance and sound quality but my wife’s top priority was noise canceling.Packaging and features looked really promising and I was a little jealous until I listened to them.  The sound quality was not even close to the Sennheiser.  I tried different ear pieces but that only helped marginally. You have to make sure you twist it in properly to get optimal bass response.  However, despite multiple adjustments I could not listen to it after being accustomed to the Sennseiser.My wife might be ok with them, but if it were for me they’d be going back."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 6, 2020",Good... NOT$300+ Good.,3.0,I had several pairs of wireless earbuds prior to buying these and honestly the reviews on the Sony buds were so good I had to try them. But honestly besides the battery life and pretty decent noise cancellation I was underwhelmed. They were BIG. I didn’t mind that but the lack of a rear stabilizer fin they constantly broke seal and has to be reseated. They weren’t dust or waterproof and I do work inside but in the trades and it was a serious concern.  But the biggest drawback was honestly they weren’t very loud. I mean seriously underpowered. My Soundcore’s are about the same size same battery life and stayed in my ears much better and kick the Sony bud’s  a$$ For sound quality range and dare I say soundstage as well. Plus the bonus of being much louder and 1/2 the price. IMHO.
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 2, 2020",Great Sound but far from perfect,3.0,"The good news is.... these wireless in ear noise cancelling earpods do provide excellent sound. They're certainly better than the original Apple Airpods.  If you, like me, still have cd's and import your discs into Itunes at a higher bit rate, say lossless or Aiff, you will be listening to your tunes at near high res quality.  The wf-1000xm3 come with not one but two apps.  I'm still uncertain what the second one does, but the main app gives you full control over your earbuds, and allows you to increase or decrease the amount of noise cancelling on the fly. (Noise cancelling on these units is acceptable but no where near as good as my Bose quiet comfort over ear headphones) The app also allows you to turn the earpods off, and provides ambient sound mode, that will literally change how much you can hear around you as you move from a seated to walking position, or from walking on the street to boarding public transportation.  (I found this feature annoying and disabled it)  User control can also be achieved by pressing the wide, flat surface of the outside of each earbud.  Left controls noise cancelling and ambient sound, whilst the right controls music, e.g 1 touch to pause, 2 touches for next song, 3 for previous song.  I've not taken any calls on the sony's, so I am unable to speak to that particular function.  One of the best features of the app, is the addition of an equalizer.  It comes with several presets (I use ""excited"") and you can even create 2 custom settings.  There is also a setting which allows the user to maintain best audio quality possible and another setting for listening to high res audio.  Bottom line, Sony made sure sound quality was the priority in their design scheme.Now for the not so good news... The earpods are heavy, quality often is, so I expected this. Sony chose to include 7 pairs of tips, including 2 small, 3 medium and 2 large.  I found that even the large weren't really giving me a snug enough fit.  In fact, one day whilst running, the left earbud fell out, onto the road, in the middle of an intersection. I can't even imagine trying to work out with these.  A better design is in order as I'm certain many people will struggle with this.Battery life and charging with these units is finicky, as is getting an accurate reading. (Apple Airpods were much better in this department)  You remove the earbuds from their charging case and if you get them in your ear fast enough, an automated voice will tell you the current charge level.  You can also get this information on your main app.  However, the units must be on and in your ear before the app will connect.  As for the charging case battery level,  you have to be connected to wifi for some odd reason, the units must be placed in the charging case for a few seconds, then removed to see the charge level.  I found this all a bit cumbersome.  I use my Sony's with active noise cancelling at full (it makes all music sound immeasurably better than without), priority on sound quality and high res DSEE HX activated.  As a result of these settings, I can achieve 4 hours of listening at 70 percent volume for approximately 4 hours.  It takes 3.5 hours to fully charge both the case and earbuds together.  The case, when fully charged will allow you to charge your earbuds up to 3 times.  It takes roughly 1.5 hours to charge your earbuds to full whilst on the go.  I had an odd occurrence where one day, I forgot my charging case.  I have a two hour commute to and from work.  The earbuds performed perfectly on route to work, and since the app allows you to set each unit to turn off after 5 seconds if not in use, I simply put them in my knapsack until I was ready to go home.  On my return journey, the app indicated I had a 70 percent charge on both the right and left earbuds, then suddenly 10 minutes before I got home, the right unit charge indicator dropped to zero and then shut off, whilst the left still indicated 70 percent charge remaining.  I'm not a fan of unexplained events with my tech, but I guess its possible that something had come in contact with the control button in my knapsack.  The charging case is a bit big to put in your pocket and if you wear skinny jeans, forget it.  That said, if you travel with a bag, purse or knapsack, you should have no problem.Overall, the sound of the Sony's is very good, clearly their best feature.  But all told, the price is a bit steep for what you get and a simplified user interface is definitely in order."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on April 20, 2021","Good but, not great",3.0,"My primary need for headphones was working in an office. I wanted to use them with my PC to attend meetings, listen to music, answer calls and attend webinars. They have been hard to het to work with my PC. Windows has not been kind to them. They will not work easily with our soft-phone software and Microsoft teams. Switching between the two programs is always an issue. You will find lots of troubleshooting online but there is no great solution. This is not the fault of the headphone, but if you are buying them for that purpose you should know.They sound good, but they don't sound much better than the 60$ wireless headphones available. The noise canceling works but not nearly as well as over the ear headphones. The ambient noise mode makes them sound bad. They don't block enough outside noise to warrant ambient passthrough mode anyway. I was supprised how ""loud"" a tap on these is. When you tap on them to change song, it can be uncomfotable on your ear drum. The Remove to pause feature is nice but doesn't always work as expected. I think it depends on if the software you are listening to is maximized.Battery life is acceptable, but not much better than other products in the class. They do charge quickly with the case. I like that the case is usb-c I don't like that it isn't wireless charge capeable.They come with lots of ear tips types and sizes. You will likely find one that lets them feel comfortable. That said they take some getting used to, my ears were sore after wearing them for long peroids. You need to find a balance between snug and too tight. If you go for a tight fit, that endds up hurting your ears if you wear them a long time, like a work day.After writing this I was verry hard on these, I am suppriesed I came up with as many conmplaints as I did. They are nice but they aren't great. They can suit your needs but you could probably find cheaper that do that too."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on May 8, 2021",Still one of the best tws in May 2021,5.0,"Absolutely amazing sounding tws. As a owner of multiple tws, iem, ote headphones, and bluetooth headphones with anc, this tws earbuds are still recommended even in 2021. Price came down quite a bit which justify the purchase. ANC is very good for tws, bluetooth connection is great, comfort is great, and sound is one of the best. Fit can be depending on how you wear this but not recommended for hard workouts. Walking, stair climbing, and regular chores are not even a problem. Make sure you get the right size eartip to get the best sounds as well as best fit which will give you secure fit. No waterproof rating but I wear it for my light workout which exposed this tws for light sweat without a problem. However, since Sony didn't give ip rating, I would not risk it unless you as a consumer are willing to risk it. I usually wear my powerbeats 3 or jaybird for workout and wear this or momentum 2 for listening to music. ANC is very good but don't expect ote headphone quality. Not even the newest bose qc tws can compete against ote anc headphones. However anc is decent enough to drown out low frequency noises. Battery life is great. Wish it had a wireless charging case but it is closer to 2 year old product since its introduction, don't expect too much on the latest tech.Pros: awesome sound with very detail notes & tight bass. Mic is great in quiet place but mediocre around loud & noise environment. Battery is excellent. Even though it's dimension is bigger on paper, it wears smaller than you think. Means it is very comfortable. App is probably the best in the industry even today. Anc is excellent. Case is bigger but holds lots of charges. And it looks elegant. Probably the best option for Android phone users or high resolution audio listeners.Cons: size does matter thus if you have small ears, I would avoid it. Case is also bigger than others. Not bass heavy tws. Sound stage is not as broad as ote headphones or other premium tws like momentum 2. Mic can be better in noisy environment. To some, App has toooooo many customizable options. Not the best for iPhone users.I compare wf-1000xm3 to bose qc tws, sennheiser momentum 2, and Beo e8 3rd Gen. I would most definitely put sony wf-1000xm3 at 2nd place just behind momentum 2 for sound. Also 2nd best at ANC. And 1st place for customization on both the functions, custom sounds, and android uses.Highly recommended even for May 2021's market if you can get it for around $175 CDN. before tax."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on March 3, 2021",Was very unimpressed - and these are supposed to be some of the best,3.0,"First off, I read and watched every review of these I could find and saw almost unanimous positivity on these with little exceptions.I tried them for a few days and have a few points of criticism for anyone looking to buy them. Look out for these things.1. Battery life was sometimes way less than the advertised 6hrs. Even with noise cancelling off, I had them die on me really fast at times. I'd leave them charging overnight, then in about 3 hours one earbud is at 20% asking me to charge it and the other is at 50%. Why the difference in charge when both are running the whole time? Who knows.2. Very uncomfortable for my ears. I don't have small ears, but my ear canals and the flap at the front of my ear were in constant pain with these. I had to use the smallest insert and because my ears aren't that small, it came at the cost of noise isolation.3. These have great noise cancelling when they are plugged into your phone, but not your laptop. I couldn't find software to operate them and it seems like, in order for the noise cancelling to work on these, it's totally software dependant. If they're not connected to your phone, don't expect noise cancelling. Something like the Bose QC lineup, you get noise cancelling no matter the device because it's built in to the product.4. The noise cancelling tries to determine different levels of noise cancelling so it's constantly messing with your audio if you are walking around your house or something. It's kind of annoying but I understand what they are trying to do. It's just cutting edge tech and not perfect by any means.5. There were times when one earbud would just cut out entirely and I had to turn them off and back on again to get sound in both ears. When you take one out the music is supposed to pause for you, but that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about randomly when you aren't moving, one single earbud will stop playing any sound while the other keeps going. In the few days of my testing this happened more than once.6. They lack depth and base. I'm not a base head by any means, but the music just sounds flat in these. I tried tinkering with the EQ in the app too. I used all settings and every setting just sounded so lacking in the ability to pull you into the song. These are supposed to have way better than average sound too. I was completely and thoroughly unimpressed. Also, I'm not an audiophile. I just have semi-decent headphones that I'm used to like the Sennheiser 598cs for mobile devices.Overall, they might be best-in-class as some say, but I think that must mean that the competition is even worse. I'll stick to wired over-ears until they figure these issues out. I'm not gonna lie, I put on some over-ears that I've had for years (Sennheiser 598cs) and plugged them into my laptop to compare sound and they blew these Sony's out of the water. The Sony's sounded terrible by comparison. Granted, these 598cs don't have noise cancelling, but the sound isolation from the closed-back cups and the overall power of their output is going to block out anything in your environment.In reality, the only advantage these Sony's have is that they're wireless and small. So they will be good for travel but still come with all those issues I listed above. Is that worth the price? I think definitely not. I think not even close."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on April 19, 2021",Honest opinion after trying them out for a few weeks.,4.0,"I have tried a few of the top of the line noise cancelling earbuds so this is my 2 cents on this pair. Pretty solid pair of earbuds and I love the look of them, but I have one small problem that may be big to a lot of others. I have average sized ears and they aren't the best when it comes to a solid snug fit. When I'm going for a light jog they seem to always over time want to fall out. I have tried literally every size of the covers they give you (which is quite a lot) and found no matter what that over time say 10-15 minutes into my run they want to fall out and I end up having to adjust them constantly. Sound quality and noise cancellation is great and I'm comparing to other top brands versions. Do I regret the purchase? not at all. They work amazingly in every way and for the price I have no complaints too. My only warning is that if you are going to be going for a run or working out or something along those lines then they may not be the best choice for you is all."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on June 21, 2020",Amazing sound quality.,5.0,"I bought these not really knowing a lot about them TBH.  I had Amazon GC's and I wanted a newer, truly wireless set of earbuds that I could use at work while I was plugging away on customer requests in the Data Center to block out the ambient noise.The sound quality is pretty good, but I am not audiophile so while they sound good to me I can't really say how good.  They sound better then my $50 wireless Anker earbuds that's for sure.It was a little disappointing after going through the setup and hearing the 3D sound that I need another subscription to another music streaming service.....I won't be doing that, even though it sounds pretty amazing.The NFC pairing is pretty nice and painless, just make sure to take the actual buds out first so your not left wondering what the heck your doing wrong when they fail to pair over and over ;)I have had some sync issues between the two earbuds, but it seems pretty sporadic and is probably being caused my interference.  I did have to default to the better connection strength option vs the better sound option in the settings.  With the better sound checked I would get some pretty annoying disconnects between the two earbuds.The noise cancelling is pretty good, but I did expect slightly better based on the reviews I watched waiting for them to arrive.  It isn't bad by any means, but it does not block 100% everything out by any means either.  The mic quality isn't bad, especially considering that there is no mic right in front if your mouth.Overall I really like the earbuds, they sound good to me and I will get quite a bit of use out of them I think, but ultimately I would wait for a sale if I were to buy them again.  I bought them at $300 CAD and they have dropped to $250 before, so maybe wait for that if you can."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on March 23, 2021",What a huge disappointment,2.0,"Bought these after my Seinnheiser earbuds quit working, hoping that these Sony's will match the sound quality. Nope, not even close. Everything else is great about them, build quality, app, battery life, noise cancellation. The sound quality is very flat, even after spending hours tinkering with the equalizer, trying to get the sound just right.I really had high expectations for these, especially after all of the positive reviews throughout the internet, but was sadly disappointed in the sound, which is the most important aspect. These will be going back and will be sticking to my old Jabra Elite 75t, which have amazing sound compared to these."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on August 14, 2020","One of the best, if not The BEST AVC truly wireless Earbuds",4.0,"I select Sony WF-1000XM3/B over iPhone Airpod pros for couple of reasons and I am glad I picked Sony headphones.1. I do not like the design/looks of Airpods Pro and,2. They are more expensive than Sony headphones.I am a serious music listener and was looking for wireless buds with excellent sound quality and battery life. I've checked and test numerous earbuds and some of them had good sound quality but poor design and fit and those who fit well lack good sound quality. Sony 1000XM3 fits well (surprisingly, know the shape of ear not all earbuds fits well), sounds great, excellent ANC function and decent touch controls (still learning) with Sony App.  So far battery life is good, I haven't tried it for a longer period of time. I wore them for almost 2 hours and I find them comfortable. Having said that, there are few things I would like Sony to iron out in their next model.1. The storage/charging case is big.2. Charging case is not wireless. I have 3 wireless pads at home and was struggle to find a plug with USB C cable for charging.3. The touch controls need refinement. Take a cue from AirPods Pro.4. Perhaps a longer battery life in future models.Overall I will give these earbuds 4.5 out of 5. I am deducting .5 points because of above mentioned reasons. I have an iPhone/iPad/MacBook etc and thoroughly enjoying Apple ecosystem but couldn't find the stomach to buy their AirPods or AirPod Pro headphones mainly because of their designs. I think they are awfully ugly. Anyone who is looking for excellent sound quality, decent battery life and comfort, I would highly recommend Sony."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on March 23, 2020",Solid,5.0,"I bought these earbuds after extensive research and considering 3 options: these Sony’s, AirPod pro & amazon echo buds. All three have ANC, which is rare to find in earbuds. All 3 have pros & cons. The AirPods are an excellent product, but the price point is just hard to justify for me. Plus the Sony’s have better sound & better noise cancelling. The echo buds offer the best value even if their ANC is really noise reduction, but it would require me crossing the border to get them as Amazon doesn’t offer these in Canada. Plus, they’re a bit bulky and by all accounts uncomfortable after extended use. Fit with earbuds is a very personal thing but I’ve found the Sony’s “twist to lock” fit to be both comfy, secure & excellent at maintaining a good seal (which help block outside noise). Sure they are not with an IP rating which AirPods Pro have, but the sound quality is better here. In fact, every time I put them on, I’m amazed at the effectiveness of the ANC and the richness of sound. As other reviewers have noted, the ambient mode may not be useful to some, but I’ve found it helpful when I need to be more aware of my surroundings. I was able to get these on sale for $249 with Amazon breaking it into five payments. At that price point I think they’re a good buy vs AirPod pro at $329. Siri integration & IP rating isn’t worth another  $80 for me. But other may disagree."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 24, 2020",Amazing,5.0,"These are spectacular earbuds. I wish they were smaller and more discreet, however this is the price you pay for the amount of technology crammed into these bad boys. I'm no audiophile but the sound is amazing. Crisp, clear highs, uninterrupted mids, and bass big enough to bounce to without killing your eardrums. The noise cancelling is pretty amazing. Obviously it is not on par with their over-ear XM3s, but for a set of earbuds, it is unexpectedly good, hence the 5 star rating. These are worth the money without question."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on May 18, 2020",Takes a bit to figure them out but every bit as good as the over the ear ones,5.0,"I own the over the ears ones and love them, but I take them everywhere with me and they can be a pain at the gym or in bed. So I decided to get the in the ear ones. I mainly love the noise cancellation feature. I was worried these wouldn't be as good. But after trying several of the buds it came with and fiddling around with the fit, I got them perfect. The software won't update all at once (not sure if this will change) so I had to go back in three times to get it to the latest version. I notice when they're synced to my phone, they sometimes cut out whereas when synced to my PC they dont. There's a lot of customization in the settings. I often turn off touch control so I can wear them to bed and set it so they automatically turn off once I take them out of my ears. You can also charge one and wear one."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 7, 2021",Very good!,5.0,"Very good noise cancellation for its size. Remember these have ANC so the noise cancellation adapts to your surroundings. You can block out all noise as well as augment the sounds around you, as in you can hear more Ambient noise. Voice calls are acceptable. I’m not quite sure how Sony can pack so much punch and in such a small package but these earbuds sound excellent (for non-audiophile ears of course). Battery life is acceptable, and the charging case adds more than enough extra hours of listening time. Plus these have the Quick Charge feature! These earbuds are very easy to pair with any device, including NFC with my Sony NWA105 Walkman. I would give these earbuds a solid 5 if it weren’t for the fact that the fit is not as secure and tight as with a sports-dedicated earbud. They don’t feel as stuck to my ears as say the Powerbeats earbuds so if you like to listen to music while moving a lot (say running) and sweating then look elsewhere, you’re probably not listening to music that carefully anyway. The WF-1000XM3 sound so much better though and that is more important to me. If you are just working, sitting in your desk or walking around and need a pair of excellent sounding truly wireless earbuds then these are for you!"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on May 25, 2020",Excellent earbuds for sound and noise cancellation,5.0,"These earbuds have very impressive sound and noise cancellation. I was afraid that the would easily fall out, but I've not had any fear of that happening.I came from a pair of Bose Soundsport, but they were starting to fall apart after a few years of use, which was disappointing for a premium product, and that I take great care of everything I own. The Sony's don't have as much bass oomf as the Bose's, but not by much, and can be easily adjustable wth the equalizer settings in the Sony Headphones Connect app. The sound clarity of the Sony's is better. Overall, the sound is excellent.Bluetooth connection is reliable, and the noise cancellation is very good, considering these are earbuds and not full size headphones with full ear covers.The only complaint I would have is the very large case, especially when in comparison to the Apple AirPods Pro, which also has wireless charging, something which the Sony lacks.Battery life is excellent, both the earbuds themselves, and the amount of charge packed into the case itself to recharge the earbuds."

On the other hand, I didnt even notice that the noise cancelation was on until I checked the app. The battery was probably the worst thing about these. I used these for maybe 3 hours and I got to 20 percent and they got really warm in my ear and it felt uncomfortable. The earbuds kept falling out and none of the tips fit my ears. I returned them because I was extremely disappointed. If they are under $100 than it's a considerable option but anything over that is a no from me."

The software is annoying.  The noise cancellation changes upon context, walking, sitting, riding a bike.  When the earbuds sense a change, the sound cuts out and new noise adaption parameters are used/or need to be set.  This is not possible if you are riding a bike.  I eventually just shut off all the adaptive noise parameters.The batteries last for about 4 hours, I would prefer 8.  I like my older earbuds better that had a wire around the back but larger batteries.I am using an iPhone and iPad, each time I want switch between the two I need go into the blue tooth settings.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on August 8, 2020",Expensive but worth it.,5.0,"I bought the cheaper model of this previously, and was not happy with no customization.These earbuds sound great, as a musician and sound mixer. The EQ and added ""clear bass"" slider lets you tune the sound to your preference. The drivers sound like they can handle the wide frequency range and I don't hear any distortion when bringing the EQ sliders to extremes.The noise cancellation and ambient sound are added bonuses. It's great being able to use earbuds and have conversations with others without needed to take one or both out. The noise cancellation really quiets things down when working in a noisy environment.The only downside I can say is that they sometimes bug out when you take them out of their case and pair them to your phone. It doesn't happen every time, but it's enough that it's noticeable. I feel like this can be an issue with any bluetooth device, so this is unavoidable unless you are constantly keeping your bluetooth device paired."

I regret it so much. One of the biggest flaws is that if they’re connected to my laptop, they will not connect to my phone even if my laptop is off. If I’m out of the house and forgot to disconnect them from my laptop before leaving I’m stuck with useless earphones. The sound quality is worse than the wired earphones that came with my iPhone. Battery on calls lasts about an hour. Battery listening to an audio book is about 90 minutes. I’ll be listening to music and randomly sound will go low and a ding will come into the left earphone for no reason, while fully charged. Putting them in pairing mode is difficult. There are no instructions for this. Sony’s website just says to press the power button which these don’t have. Even after finding and following the correct instructions it doesn’t always work. They stay in my ears but not snug. I hate using them at all anymore because the regret of this purchase is so gut wrenching."

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on August 1, 2020",Excellent sound quality despite being wireless,5.0,"For a long time I avoided any wireless headphones due to my impression that there was always a steep compromise in sound quality compared to wired headphones.  In this case, I was really pleasantly surprised.  The sound is deep and rich.  Only one oddity reviewers mentioned on other sites is that if you keep noise cancelling disabled, then there will be almost no bass frequencies, leaving the sound a bit thin and flat.  Sounds like a small software flaw IMHO, as the sound becomes MUCH richer once you enable noise cancelling (regardless of how quiet your environment is).One early complain was about the lack of gesture volume control - this was added with a firmware update.  Touch controls are somewhat configurable using the app, however you cannot configure each gesture individually - you can only select a group of gesture per earphone.  That means if you set one side for volume control and the other for noise cancellation control, then you won't be able to also do track pause/skipping.It took me a while to decide which of the numerous included in-ear pieces were most confortable, and to learn how to properly position the earphone within my ears, but once you get used to it, they are fairly confortable and easy to put on.I haven't tested them in a really noisy environment (like on the bus) yet, but at home it very effectively cancelled the noise of the standing fan I use in my living room during the recent heat wave."

Turn your head, or put your hand in your pocket above your phone - dropped signal.I tried on another phone; and on a desktop - same issues with connectivity.

Unfortunately, they're plagued with a whole host of other problems that make them practically unusable. The microphone quality might be the worst I've ever encountered. During audio calls, I constantly have to take these earphones off and switch to the built in microphone on my iPhone due to the complaints that I get from people about loud background noise, as well as voice distortion that results in me sounding like Optimus Prime.In order to use the earphones effectively, you must download Sony's ""Headphones"" app. However, while my headphones are connected to my device, I constantly get an error form the app telling me that there is no device connected, even while I'm playing music. On top of this, they aren't water resistant, they're obnoxiously bulky and sticky out of your ears like those weird Bluetooth earpieces that people used to wear. I bought these to replace my near broken Airpods, but I end up still getting more use out of those anyways.Seems like Sony really missed the mark on functionality here."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on June 25, 2020",I wanted to love these...,2.0,"First of all, fit is very important with true wireless earbuds. Unfortunately, the left earbud would not stay in place no matter the different tips and wings I tried on. The seal would eventually break off and the bud would start to slip from my ear. I believe the main culprit is the fact that so much of the earbud hangs from the outside of the ear, making it easy to fall off once the seal is compromised. Otherwise, I did enjoy the sound that these produce as well as the useful app. When in place, I found that the noise cancellation was only okay. The over-ear headphones version of these work way better. For example, I wore these next to a busy intersection and with NC at the highest level, noise generated from trafic was softened but still present. Also, the case on these was too big to be pocketable. In the end, I kept the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ I ordered and returned these."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 15, 2021",Could not tell they weren't new,5.0,"I bought these Sony WF-1000M3 earbuds used through Amazon Warehouse. Other than no plastic wrap on the box everything appeared brand new. I charged them up, downloaded the app, and they work well.The sound quality is great. I have a pair of HRB5033 earbuds that I bought for $89 Canadian and a pair of Jabra Elite 85h that I paid much more for. In the past couple days I've been doing a comparison of the sound quality and features of all three with different types of music and different background noise. The most notable difference is that the Sony earbuds have a much better defined and rich bass when compared to the HRB earbuds (the HRB earbuds are close to the Sony in the mid/high range though). The Jabra Elite headphones provide the best quality sound and noise cancelling of all three which is to be expected from a pair of high quality over the ear headphones. But the sound quality and noise cancelling of the Jabra Elite headphones is not significantly better than the Sony earbuds just a bit better in my opinion.I had bought Sony earbuds to have a smaller noise cancelling alternative to my Jabra Elite headphones and I'm happy with their noise cancelling abilities. I've tried them under different background noise scenarios and they blocked much of the outside sounds while not interfering with the quality of the music. The HRB earbuds have no noise cancelling so in the past I lugged my Jabra Elite headphone to coffee shops and other public places when I wanted to listen to music but not want it to be drowned out by the background noises. Now I can take the much smaller Sony earbuds.I really like that the Sony earbuds allow me to control the volume by touching the left earbud contol area which I can't do with the HRB earbuds. There are options for what you want the control surfaces of the Sony earbuds to control. This means that you must choose which options mean the most to you. I chose volume control on the left with skip forward, pause, and skip backwards on the right. But gave up the options for talk through, or to engage the assistant.The Sony earbuds and case are substantially bigger than the HRB earbuds. The Sony case is twice as big so throwing them in my pants pocket isn't as practical. But Sony case is about half the size of one Jabra Elite earcup so they will be much more useful when I don't have room to bring my full headohones with me.All three connect easily to all the devices I set up for them. There were no issues pairing. I've had no issues with connectivity with any of these devices.I don't use my headphones or earbuds for voice communications so I can't make any useful comments about that feature.I can't talk about battery life as I only got these a vouple days ago."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on March 5, 2021",Really good but...,3.0,"I have tried these for over a month with my s10+, they are really good when it comes to sound quality and they are rich in features, like, you won't even know their full features even if you had them for a long time, they surprise you everyday. the app is also really good and allows you to control and set them according to however you like and comes with an adaptive sound feature that is alright for those who works in a quieter environment. On the other hand, I experienced frequent disconnections as well as while I am in the midst of a call, they just randomly disconnects, sometimes one of them disconnects. They do appear connected on the phone itself though. Other weird thing for me was while I am in a call they starts to sound like the voice is coming from a balloon, you can't hear anything at all. I ordered a replacement and the other pair did the same thing, I thought I wear it under my turban ,maybe that could be the reason, but even without it had these problems, so I decided to return them. Thanks."

I tried all the sizes of plastic buds, but the extra weigh make it prone to fall, as soon as I sweat a little. It's ok if I' stationnary, but then I don't care between wired and wireless headphones. Ironically, I bought a 20$ bluetooth sleeping mask, with headphones in them, and they have a much longer battery life, so I end up using those instead, as it's a headband that does not fall. The sound quality is ok, the noise cancellation was ok too (though it's nothing compared to a seinsheiser headset).It was a test for me, to see if my next phone should have a headphone jack or not, and yhea, it'll have one. What a dumb trend, to not put a headphone jack on phones... really annoying."

The left earbud often doesn’t charge in the case, making it die earlier than the right. Often the earbuds will completely disconnect from the device I’m listening to (happens with my phone and laptop) and I have to reset the connection. These make the earbuds very frustrating to use, especially as I had purchased them for listening to music while working and taking phone calls at home. Overall, the music quality is worth the price you pay, however these issues make them feel cheap and poorly designed.EDIT: I called Sony regarding my issues and found out that they were covered by a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty. Within a 10-minute phone call, Sony placed an order for a replacement pair of brand new headphones and sent me a prepaid shipping label to return my pair. Very impressed with the customer service!"

The sound quality of these earbuds is not good -- but great. The sound is accurate and is exceptional in every way. Describing the sound in a more descriptive way, it has clear highs and defined bass. The sound is top-tier.Sound quality is always relevant and is the most important attribute of earbuds. Technical achievement.Reliability is also important. In terms of connectivity, audio/video latency, and general reliablity, these earbuds work pretty well.

Very good dynamic range. The noise cancelling is impressive. The only issue I have these is others can hear what I'm listening to if it's above 50% so soundbleed isn't the best.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 20, 2019","Great sound quality, noise cancelling is okay...",4.0,"The sound quality is great. Just keep all the supposed ""enhancements"" off, and you get a clear, balanced sound despite the tiny size of the earbud itself. Battery life does reach 6 hours without noise cancelling, but if you turn it on, it drains quite a bit faster. The case does recharge the earbuds very fast (I get about 4 hours of listening for 1 hour of charging), and the earbuds themselves are quite comfortable and don't fall off as long as they are inserted snugly into your ear. You do need to insert the earbud with the R/L symbol facing up and away from your face, and then rotate them until the Sony logo is horizontal. If you try to just push them in, they will fall off. This is actually explained in the manual, but it's not intuitive. Follow the instructions and they will stay in.My biggest complaint is that the noise cancelling is not nearly as good as with on-ear headphones. You can clearly hear everything around you, even with the proper size inserts. This is to be expected for earbuds, but the marketing for this product makes it seem revolutionary. If you want near silence, you need full-size over-ear headphones. If you want to take the bus or metro and still be able to hear your music, these little earbuds get the job done quite well, but don't expect miracles."

In-calls are garbage crackly sounding and unstable, Mic lets in way too much ambient noise, cars driving by sound like airplanes.I sent a pair back because the left ear was getting roughly 2 hour battery life when it states 6 hours. The same results with the second pair possibly slightly longer. I got them on a good deal at $200 CAD so not a massive investment, but I really need something that will give me 6-8 hours or a standard working day. Anything short of that isn't super useful.

There was a point where I wanted to return these earbuds because of the app issues. There are two different apps Sony Music Centre and Headphones. I do not know If I'll need both these apps.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 27, 2021",A great product!,5.0,"Firstly, they arrived a day early, and FedEx gave me an automated call to let me know a signature was needed for delivery. Very appreciated!My previous earbuds were FiiO FH5s and as has happened to many, the mxcm cable use caused damage in one earbud. Sigh. I then wanted true wireless in order to avoid cable wear.I read many reviews and Sony won, mostly for the good fit with Apple products’ operating systems vs others’ experiences with competitors.It’s been a few days and I would say there was a burn-in to them... but also attenuation of getting used to their sound profile. I’m a classical singer by profession who listens to a lot of baroque, but who also loves prog rock and metal and everything in between. These buds work for everything, I find!The 360 Real Audio is a pretty neat trick, and though the free material to demo it is limited, it is a novel and magical experience in a way. It made me more open to styles of music I usually don’t vibe with. I may explore a subscription to a platform that supports it.The tips that come with the device don’t work for me. Too small. I’m using the large silicone ones from the FH5s and the seal is great—but they slip off the buds too easily due to the driver size difference, I am guessing. But I ordered some Complys meant specifically for this model.Battery life is pretty good, but it’ll be something to get used to on long trips, of having to charge them in the carrying case—which is gorgeous by the way.They are SUPER comfortable and light. The ANC is really incredible. Still getting used to the tap controls and you do feel like “one of those people” when tapping your ear to talk to someone. I may just opt to remove one bud, which pauses audio, anyway :)All in all I am quite pleased! There was worry at first since the volume level on initial trials seemed very low, but that may have been settings in one of my apps. Watching some trailers on Youtube proved their power. Speaking of which, for wireless buds, they are very loud compared to wireless FH5s.So, yes, get these ones, unless you have other needs! Cheers."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on February 18, 2021",I expected SO much more for $200,2.0,"I don't usually write reviews but I felt obliged to do so here because after everything I read about these XM3's and how great they were I decided to plunk down $223 (after tax) on these to replace my $23 (after discounts) Vankyo X200 True Wireless earbuds that I got from Amazon last year. Now I'm no audiophile expert but I do have a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro cans and Fiio FH5 wired earphones so I appreciate good sound quality which is why I wanted to give these a try.I tried the XM3's and my cheapy X200's on a Galaxy Tab S6 tablet and an LG Velvet with both using the Fiio Music app with equalizer. I had both side by side for quick switch outs and tried both pair on both units and I even used the same ear tips from my FH5's on both to be sure all things were equal, what I found was shocking to me.These XM3's have virtually no bass and ear piercing highs that drowns out any bass that's there at higher volumes. The sound quality is fine and the noise cancelling lives up to the reputation but where's the bass? Any bass! Regardless of what I played, rock, jazz, classical and no matter how I adjusted the EQ I found the bass almost non existent. At the same volume and EQ settings for both (on both units) the X200's are louder, had a solid base punch with respectable highs and mids that didn't drown out the bass, in my opinion sounded better in every way! To be fair, the X200's have no noise cancelling and they are bulkier and not quite as comfortable but for $200 less? I can live with that!To close out, this experience proved to me spending more on a brand name doesn't always mean you get a product you like better, I'm sure the XM3's are probably a superior product in many ways but my ears tell me they don't beat out my $23 pair of X200's where it counts.....the sound!. I'll use my X200's until they die or something better comes along but I'll be returning these XM3's for refund."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on September 6, 2020",Noise cancelling is a game changer.,4.0,"First thing you should do is follow the instructions (duh) and 2nd is swap the ear gummies if necessary for a firm fit.Right of out the box these have 20% battery life so charge them prior to use. The noise cancelling is honestly a blessing, I’m impressed; even when the music is paused the cancelling still blocks out the household air conditioner which can normally be heard throughout the entire house. This guarantees that you can relax at lower volumes and if need be, you can slightly adjust to drown out higher ambient noises.The sound is impressive, well balanced and crisp. With noise cancelling active, you will need to turn the volume higher than normal to get the more energized sounds you are used to, it’s a fair compromise, you can still achieve high volumes with noise cancelling quite easily... lastly, these come with various sized ear gummies, even after finding the best fitting ones, up and down motions nudge these quite noticeably, absolutely no jogging with these on, they are an expensive piece of technology and you should know better than to blame anyone but yourself if these fell out during an intense work out."

And I HATED the sound. They just sounded really muffled and had no bass, and wouldn’t stay in my ear. So I just put them back in the box and kept them in there for a few months.Decided to give them another shot. And I tried the different ear tip sizes they came with and found ones that stayed in my ears and sounded more clear.And I also just put it on Noise Cancelling instead of Ambient Mode, and the bass on these are amazing now and sound way better.I really have no use for Ambient Mode, even though it’s a super cool feature. But I bought these to just listen to music in my room or if i ever went on a little road trip.So if you’ve purchased these, or thinking or purchasing them. Change the ear tips that fit in your ears. And download the app for more settings to make it better."

Sound quality is THE best in my opinion ,how sony could put all amazing features in this little thing is phenomenal. I was concern about call quality after watching lot of reviews , Sony has resolved that in upgrading its software, it's so important big company behaviour's on listening to reviews its unusual . Things I didn't like is I like button and click sound. It works on my brain better, unfortunately these are touch sensors which works well no problem , the most important one is Sony decided for client that we can't have volume and pause n play in right earbud. You must have both on to get all features available . I mean softwarewise it was nothing ,but deciding how client to behave is not great, all forgiven when music goes on.

I'll see how well the noise cancelling compares with the IC20 in a few weeks when I hop on a plane again.I think the sound quality was perhaps a little better on the IC20 in my opinion.One last cool feature and maybe I'm just stupid since I'm new to wireless headphones but the fact that they can charge while they are in their case even if the case isn't connected to a charger is a very convenient feature."

When you start cranking up the volume past the half way mark, there is a little like noise but if you listen to it with normal volume level, the earbuds are going to be fine.

HUGE wind noise if you use them outside with ANC or transparency mode on.(Sony |Headphones Connect) APP connection problem. Many times, with my earbuds out from my case, even playing music, the app just won’t recognize and connect. I have to put them in and out again or few times to connect properly. Lastly, the passive noise block is already great enough to let u listen music comfortably at medium volume.

Awesome sound quality. Crappy for phone calls. Worth it if main purpose is excellent quality sound. All of the ear cushions kinda suck tho. May have to upgrade to better aftermarket ones
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 1, 2019",Great little buds with big sound.,5.0,"These little buds definitely pack a punch. They sound amazing and have the clarity of overhead earphones. Along with noise cancellation a very good equalizer app and numerous other features, these are definitely my favourite headphones. I would definitely recommend these to anyone. Two thumps up lol👍👍"
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on August 31, 2020",Impressed,5.0,"These earbuds are pretty great. Tes they are not as good as noise cancelling as over ear headphones but they seal tight and cancel out a ton of sound. Even with the noise cancelling off they passively block tons of sound. I have to turn on the ""hear through"" mode to be able to hear someone talking next to me.Sound quality is clean and crisp. I went from Bose sound sport to these and am not going back!They come with 6 different ear tips so that you can find the best fit."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on January 21, 2021",Terrible Bluetooth Connection. Bad for Voice calls.,1.0,Bluetooth would not connect to laptop. On voice calls there was a 1 sec. delay between the left and right ear. Right ear beeped and turned off repeatedly. The sound quality was great when they worked but the Bluetooth connection was so terrible it was not worth it.I did a lot of online research before purchasing and thought I was going to be purchasing a high quality product. I was able to return but it costed $20 in return shipping fees. Overall very disappointed. Will not be purchasing Sony headphones again.
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on December 23, 2019",Sound quality not as great as it is claimed to be,3.0,"These for ANC are great... But for sound quality i am sorry... My 1MORE True Wireless(1/3rd the price) and my BOSE Soundsports both sounded much better than these considering the 300$ price tag.. I was expecting much better sound quality for the price tag to be honest... I know that sound quality may be subjective to a lot of people but these were a total dissapointment compared to the BOSE... Maybe i am just too used to the BOSE soundstage.... Not sure... Suund was flat, bass was virtually non-existant and loudness left much to be desired...."

Very good for in ear plugs.Noise cancelling is pretty poor.You need the over ear model for good NC.I bought these used on Amazon.The battery life, as it turns out, is terrible.I'm quite sure they were very used by the time I got them.No warning about that.So buyer beware.Therefore the 2 star rating."

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 15, 2020",Don't buy if you plan to use it with helmet,2.0,"The tap function on the right earphone is stupid. You can control the tap functions in the app but you can't disable the hold mode on the right earphone. It was designed to pause the music but when you wear a helmet in biking or skiing, the helmet will pressure on the earphone so you don't hear anything. If you turn your head around, the helmet may not touch the phone so suddenly you hear the sound from right earphone. It's just a bad design."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on July 17, 2020",Unreliable Connection and Limited Function,2.0,"The headphones were great for the first few days! I had no complaints, the sound is great and the noise cancellation is excellent. However, a few days after I bought them, the right headphone stopped working. Completely stopped working. It wasn't charging or connecting to the application on my phone. The other issue I had was that it was only compatible with my phone. I couldn't connect them to my laptop (I know that's not the end of the world, but for the price I was paying I was hoping they would be more versatile)."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on December 5, 2020",terrible battery life,1.0,Lots of good can be said .. but I really thought when it said 6 hours of battery life off a full charge it meant 6 hours and not 2 to 3 before and annoying voice starts chirping low batteryAnd this is week one.. I can imagine the battery life getting worse.
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on July 27, 2020",Not the greatest,3.0,I say not the greatest not because of the noise cancellation - which works good.  (notice I did not say it worked great)But because they keep slipping / popping out of my ears. :(
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 6, 2020",Better sound and ear fit then Sony,3.0,Bose has a better definition of the music sound then Sony wf-1000xm3 and the fit on the Bose are much more comfortable and stable. With the Sony i was always ajusting them affecting the sound separation. Much happyer now to have return the Sony.
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on December 15, 2020","Not bad, but get it on sale",4.0,Noise cancelling weaker than headset xm3 but that's expected. Have a tendency to amplify contact noises if your hoodie made contact against the earpods. Not exactly comfortable for wearing for a long period of time. (my ears starts to get uncomfortable after 1 hour) Overall sound quality is good enough.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 4, 2019",Fit may be an issue,4.0,"Great sound and features.  Comfortable but I just couldn’t get a tight seal with them, particularly in my left ear.  The left always get like it was going to fall out.  This despite a large array of tips provided by Sony.  Perhaps the kidney shape is the cause.  I tried a Set of Comply Tips I use on a set of Sennheiser True Wireless and even though they work well on the Sennheiser they did not rectify the issue with the Sony.  A shame because this issue aside they were extremely good."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 9, 2020",Not suitable for (all?) Video Conference Meetings,2.0,Bought to use on Zoom etc meeting with iPad. As soon as you turn them on the sound or video on your meeting drops. Also tried on another platform. Read on user forums that it uses the same “frequency” (for lack of a more technical term). A lot of $ spent to find them not suitable.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on April 6, 2021",Great - Noise Cancellation is a little EXAGGARATED (doesn't work in the gym).,2.0,"I bought these A couple Months ago. They were great at first, but now it can't even hold a charge - both case and headphones rendering the product USELESS after a few months. Now the charging case is always red (never changes) and the headphones can't hold a battery charge. Complaints are also noise cancellation is exaggerated and the active noise software doesn't seem good. Toggles on/off at improper times. I give it a 3.8/5 for the money."
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on July 30, 2020",Call quality is poor and fitting is a big issue,3.0,"Everything is great but they are worst in fitting. They come off quite often from my ears. If I want to pick up something of the ground, they pop out from my ears. This one flaw has made my experience terrible.One more low point: the call quality is never good. I have often taken off these earbuds when I have received a call because of the poor quality."

The Sony's crush all of them. Sound quality is phenomenal. It's a night and day difference.
"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on October 24, 2020",Very comfortable,5.0,I was surprised by the comfort and sound quality of this headset. I have several other types and brands of headphones and headsets at similar or higher price points but this is now my go to headphone for listening music. The noise cancellation works very well and it does improve the sound quality of music by cutting out ambient sounds.

"Sony WF-1000XM3/B Industry Leading Noise Canceling Truly Wireless Earbuds, Black","Reviewed in Canada on November 6, 2020",Too heavy,3.0,"These are great but are too big for my girlfriend.  It’s not that she couldn’t find the right earbud - they are so heavy that when she leans forward they come loose.  If she does it again, without fail, they will fall out.  She’s almost lost them a couple times.  I would love to return them but unfortunately she didn’t tell me until after the one month warranty expired.  It’s been about two months now since my order."

They have great portability, great noise cancelling. I take them to the gym and don't have any issue while running.The only issues I have had:  - The touches on the buds sometimes don't register.  - They often slide out of my ear, but I might just need to find the right in ear end.  -They did provide a lot of in ear attachments, I just need to find the right one."

When I finally got a decent sound I found it very difficult to switch devices.  The battery ran out after  about 2 and a half hours. What made me return them was when I put on my son's Airpods and realized they actually had better sound quality than the Sony's.  Very disappointing!!"

The ANC feature is fully customizable with the Sony app and the sound quality can be really dialed up. My only reason I'm giving it 4 Stars is because it keeps disconnecting with my MBP and S10. Otherwise it's a great device.

I ended up returning then after a couple of days and purchasing a new pair of Pros. The Pros are simply better on all fronts.
